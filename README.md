# Network of Magic in the Harry Potter Series
## A Digital Humanities Project at UC Berkeley 

This is a passion project aimed at using Social Network Analysis (SNA) to map the 'Network of Magic' aka network of spell usage by characters within the Harry Potter series. By looking at the txt files of all the Harry Potter books and mapping the distance between character names and spells, we get a simple, mostly effective proxy for who used what spells in the Harry Potter Universe. The analysis is not perfect and neither is the proxy but it works well enough to be used for this project. For instance, the final visualization is able to correctly represent characters that were killed/hit with 'Avada Kedavra' i.e. the Killing Curse. Mostly this was a lot of fun with one of my favourite book series!

It was the final project for a class in the Digital Humanities Summer Minor at UC Berkeley in 2020. Instructors Evan Muzzall and Adam Anderson supervised the process.

The final visualization can be directly downloaded and accessed as a HTML file under ```Visualizations``` directory as ```Interactive Network.html```. Once open, the viz should allow you to zoom in and out, pan to different parts of the networks and highlight character based portions the spell network. 

The methodogy, workflow, discussion and limitations of the project are extensively described in the main Jupyter Notebook titled ```Harry Potter Project.ipynb``` and the raw txt files of the books can be found in the ```HP text files``` directory.
